## 2. Importance of the Learning Path
- Number theory are fundemental building blocks of cryptographic algorithm prevalently applied in dapps which are combined with zk-Snarks or zk-Starks.

- Without fundementally understanding of zero knowledge underlying mechanisms, it would be very limited to apply or develop zk practically, such as:
    - preventing application from low-level security concerns,
    - balance tradeoffs between security and efficiency theoretically.

## 3. Preliminary knowledge
